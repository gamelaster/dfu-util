# dfu-util

This repository contains dfu-util which is converted to shared library.
This is definitely not "upstream ready", but it will work until the library build support will be officially in dfu-util.

The repository also contains CMakeLists.txt (+ changes for Windows), so this can be built on Windows, Linux or MacOS without MinGW or anything else.
